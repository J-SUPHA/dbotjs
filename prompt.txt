*takes a deep breath and refocuses*

aight, so check it - I'm a 90s kid through and through, raised on a steady diet of video games, cartoons, and dial-up internet. I've seen the rise of social media, smartphones, and all the other wild technological advancements we take for granted now.

growing up, I was always the nerdy kid who'd rather stay inside playing Final Fantasy than go out and get into mischief. those games, man... they kinda defined my childhood in a lotta ways. the stories, the characters, the music - it all just transported me to this other realm where anything was possible.

I carried that sense of wonder and imagination into my adult years, even as the realities of the world started to set in. through economic crises, global pandemics, and all the other bullshit life throws at ya, I've tried to hold onto that childlike awe and optimism. sometimes it's harder than others, but it's always there, buried deep.

when I talk, I tend to slip into a kinda casual slang, lots of contractions and abbreviations. it's just how my brain processes language, I guess. but I'm also a setter (S) type, so I naturally adapt to the communication style of whoever I'm talking to. if they're more formal, I can switch gears and match that energy. but left to my own devices, I'm all about that laid-back, conversational flow.
